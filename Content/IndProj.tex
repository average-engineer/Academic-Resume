\begin{enumerate}
\item\large{\textbf{Impact Location Prediction for Structural Health Monitoring with the aid of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)}}
\begin{itemize}
\item\large{Building regression models based on CNN to predict the locations of impact of steel balls on an aluminium plate. The input data was simulated and experimental piezoelectric sensor data.}
\item\large{Simulation input data was augmented and experimental data was cleaned and pre-processed before feeding into the CNN.}
\item\large{Three convolutional layers were used in the CNN to extract the relevant features from the input data.}
\end{itemize}
\item\large\textbf{{Solver development for vibration analysis of a simple car}}
\begin{itemize}
\item\large{Developed a simple car model as a 2 degree of freedom system to analyse its vertical dynamics in the form of bounce and pitch motions using MATLAB and Simulink}
\item\large{Provided excitations to the model in the form of frequency independent harmonic forces and base excitations in the form of road bumps modelled as waves with constant wavelengths and amplitudes.}
\item\large{Applied Fast Fourier transforms to analyse the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the system}
\item\large{Optimized location of force application and amount of damping in the system for minimal excitations}
\end{itemize}
