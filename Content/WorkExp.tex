\begin{itemize}
	\item Development of a localization algorithm for a swarm of GPS-denied UAVs using Ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors and embedding the developed localization algorithm into \emph{Arducopter}, an open-source auto-pilot for UAVs, in order to facilitate verification of the algorithm through flight tests.
    \item Development of a simulation model of an integrated flight control system for a single UAV, including a flight controller, 6 degree-of-freedom UAV dynamic model, IMU, Magnetometer, Barometer and GPS sensor models and an Extended Kalman Filter for attitude estimation.

\begin{itemize}
\item \large{Scripting Multi-Body simulation models of a standard mountain bike in Simpack using the \emph{Semi-Analytical Approach} where the multibody model partly depends on real-time sensing of loads on the actual bike and setting up co-simulation between Simpack and Simulink in a closed loop simulation for stabilizing the multibody model excited by the measured loads. }
%\item\large{Testing various linear control techniques in order to achieve disturbance rejection}.
\item\large{The \href{https://github.com/average-engineer/MiniThesis_IGMR/blob/master/Thesis.pdf}{\large{work}} in this project culminated in a mini-thesis worth 9 ECTS.}
