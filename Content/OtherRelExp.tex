%\hspace{0.3 in}
%\majordaterig
\begin{itemize}
\item \large{Built a test stand acting as an alternative to the wind tunnel for measuring the thrust produced by a propeller mounted on it.}
\item\large{Implemented Arduino Uno controlled circuits for driving the propeller motor using a brush-less DC motor and capturing and displaying the speed of the propeller using an IR sensor based tachometer.}

%\majordateprop
\begin{itemize}
\item\large{Generated and modified propeller designs iteratively based on required flying conditions and propeller thrust using QMIL, a first order propeller design tool}
\item\large{Used QPROP, a solver for calculating propeller performance to generate propeller efficiency and thrust curves for the designed propellers and reiterated the designing process until a design giving desirable propeller performance was achieved.}
\item\large{Assisted in second order design validation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) once the propeller design showed better performance than a market standard propeller.}
\item\large{Developed a solver acting as an alternative to QPROP in MATLAB for calculating the performance characteristics of a propeller based on Blade Element Momentum Theory.}
